        <p>
          DevOps is a term for a group of concepts that, while not all new,
          catalyzed into a movement in 2009 and rapidly spread throughout the
          technical community.&nbsp; Like any popular term, people often have
          confused and contradictory impressions of what it means.&nbsp; Here’s my
          take on how DevOps can be usefully defined; I propose this definition as
          a standard framework to more clearly discuss the various areas DevOps
          covers. Like “Quality” or “Agile,” DevOps is a large enough concept that
          it requires some nuance to fully understand.
        </p>
        <h2>Definition of DevOps</h2>
        <p>
          DevOps emerged from the collision of two major related trends. The first
          was called “agile infrastructure” or “agile operations”; it sprang from
          applying Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.&nbsp; The second
          is an expanded understanding of the value of collaboration between
          development and operations staff throughout all stages of the
          development lifecycle when creating and operating a service, and how
          important operations has become in our increasingly service-oriented
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that you can define DevOps practically as:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers
              participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design
              through the entire development process all the way to deployment and
              production support.
            </strong>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          A primary corollary to this is that part of the major change in practice
          from previous methods is incorporation of knowledge from each field into
          the other.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use of many
              of the same techniques as developers for their systems work, and
              development staff creating applications designed to work well in an
              operational environment.</strong>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Developer techniques that operations learns to use in a DevOps
          environment range from using source control to developing infrastructure
          as code (including testing) to participating in an Agile development
          process.&nbsp; Operational concerns built into systems include
          observability and resilience. Both tend to use continuous integration
          and delivery as the means of iterating on a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          “DevOps” is intended to be maximally inclusive. It doesn’t differentiate
          between different sysadmin sub-disciplines – “Ops” is a blanket term for
          systems engineers, system administrators, operations staff, release
          engineers, DBAs, network engineers, security professionals, and various
          other subdisciplines and job titles. “Dev” is used as shorthand for
          front end and back end developers in particular, but really in practice
          it is even wider and means “all the people involved in developing the
          product,” which can include Product, QA, and other disciplines.
        </p>
        <p>
          DevOps has strong affinities with Agile and Lean approaches. The old
          view of operations tended towards the “Dev” side being the “makers” and
          the “Ops” side being the “people that deal with the creation after its
          birth” – the harm that has been done in the industry from those two
          being treated as siloed concerns is the core driver behind DevOps. In
          this way, DevOps can be interpreted as an outgrowth of Agile – agile
          software development prescribes close collaboration of customers,
          product management, developers, and (sometimes) QA to fill in the gaps
          and rapidly iterate towards a better product – DevOps says “yes, but
          service delivery and how the app and systems interact are a fundamental
          part of the value proposition to the client as well, and so the product
          team needs to include those concerns as a top level concern.” From this
          perspective, DevOps is simply extending Agile principles beyond the
          boundaries of “the code” to the entire delivered service.
        </p>
        <h2>Definition In Depth</h2>
        <p>
          DevOps means a lot of different things to different people because the
          discussion around it covers a lot of ground.&nbsp; People talk about
          DevOps being “developer and operations collaboration,” or it’s “treating
          your code as infrastructure,” or it’s “using automation,” or “using
          kanban,” or “a toolchain approach,” or “culture,” or a variety of
          seemingly loosely related items.&nbsp; The reason this is confusing is
          that there are different levels of concern within DevOps, with higher
          level concerns informing more specific implementation in lower levels.
          Here’s a taxonomy to clarify the space.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>DevOps Values</strong> – I believe the fundamental DevOps
            values are effectively captured in the Agile Manifesto – with perhaps
            one slight emendation to focus on the overall service or software
            fully delivered to the customer instead of simply “working software.”
            Some previous definitions of DevOps, like Alex Honor’s “People over Process over Tools,” echo basic Agile
            Manifesto statements and urge dev+ops
            collaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DevOps Principles</strong> – There is not a single agreed upon
            list, but there are several widely accepted attempts –
            <a href="http://www.getchef.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/">here’s John Willis coining
              “CAMS”</a>
            and
            <a href="http://www.kartar.net/2010/02/what-devops-means-to-me/">here’s James Turnbull giving his own
              definition</a>
            at this level. “Infrastructure as code” is a commonly cited DevOps
            principle. I’ve made a cut at “DevOps’ing” the existing Agile manifesto and principles. I personally believe
            that DevOps at the conceptual level is mainly
            just the widening of Agile’s principles to include systems and
            operations instead of stopping its concerns at code checkin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DevOps Methods</strong> – Some of the methods here are Agile;
            you can use Scrum with operations, Kanban with operations, etc.
            (although usually with more focus on integrating ops with dev, QA, and
            product in the product teams). There are some more distinct methods,
            like
            <a href="http://itpi.3dcartstores.com/BookseBooks_c_11.html">Visible Ops</a>-style change control and
            <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2008/public/schedule/detail/1525">using the Incident Command System
              for
              incident reponse</a>. The set of these methodologies are growing; a more thoughtful
            approach to monitoring is an area where common methodologies haven’t
            been well defined, for example.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DevOps Practices</strong> –Specific techniques used as part of
            implementing the above concepts and processes. Continuous integration
            and continuous deployment, “Give your developers a pager and put them
            on call,” using configuration management, metrics and monitoring
            schemes, a toolchain approach to tooling… Even using virtualization
            and cloud computing is a common practice used to accelerate change in
            the modern infrastructure world.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DevOps Tools</strong> – Tools you’d use in the commission of
            these principles. In the DevOps world there’s been an explosion of
            tools in release (jenkins, travis, teamcity), configuration management
            (puppet, chef, ansible, cfengine), orchestration (zookeeper, noah,
            mesos), monitoring, virtualization and containerization (AWS,
            OpenStack, vagrant, docker) and many more. While, as with Agile, it’s
            incorrect to say a tool is “a DevOps tool” in the sense that it will
            magically bring you DevOps, there are certainly specific tools being
            developed with the express goal of facilitating the above principles,
            methods, and practices, and a holistic understanding of DevOps should
            incorporate this layer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the end, DevOps is a little tricky to define, just like its
          older&nbsp;brother Agile. But it’s worth doing. When left at the pure
          philosophy level, both can seem like empty mom-and-apple-pie statements,
          subject to the criticism “You’re just telling me ‘do my job better,’
          duh…” But conversely, just the practices without the higher level
          guidance turn into a cargo cult. “I do what this Scrum book says so I’m
          doing Agile” is as erroneous as&nbsp;“I’m using Chef so I’m DevOps
          right?” To be a successful Agile or DevOps practitioner is to understand
          all the layers that go into it, and what a given DevOps implementation
          might contain or not contain. In the end, what DevOps hopes to bring to
          Agile is the understanding and practice that software isn’t done until
          it’s successfully delivered to a user and meets their expectations
          around availability, performance, and pace of change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, I’ve come to believe there are three primary practice
          areas that are usually discussed in context of DevOps.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure Automation</strong> – create your systems, OS
            configs, and app deployments as code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> – build, test, deploy your apps
            in a fast and automated manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Site Reliability Engineering</strong> – operate your systems;
            monitoring and orchestration, sure, but also designing for operability
            in the first place.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>History of DevOps</h2>
        <p>
          The genesis of DevOps comes from an increasing need for innovation on
          the systems side of technology work.&nbsp; The DevOps movement inherits
          from the Agile System Administration movement and the Enterprise Systems
          Management (ESM) movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          ESM, which arose in the mid-2000’s, provided the original impetus of
          “Hey, our methodology of running systems seems to still be in a pretty
          primitive state despite years of effort.&nbsp; Let’s start talking about
          doing it better.”&nbsp; John Willis, whurley, and Mark Hinkle from
          Zenoss were involved in that, and sponsored a
          <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampESM">BarCamp around the concept</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think during this phase,
          initial enchantment with
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL">ITIL</a> as a governance
          framework was largely overthrown for the “ITIL Lite”
          <a href="http://www.itpi.org/the-visible-ops-handbook-review.html">Visible Ops</a>
          approach, as well as a shift from being “large vendor” focused – used to
          be, the enterprise frameworks like HP, IBM, and CA were the only
          meaningful solutions to end to end systems management, but more open
          source and smaller vendor stuff was coming out, including Spiceworks,
          Hyperic, Zenoss, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also in 2008, the first
          <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2010">Velocity conference</a> was
          held by O’Reilly, focusing on Web performance and operations, which
          provided a venue for information sharing around operations best
          practices. In 2009 there were some important presentations about the
          developer/operations collaboration at large shops (most notably
          <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr">Flickr</a>)
          and
          how that promoted safe, rapid change in&nbsp;Web
          environments.&nbsp; Provisioning tools like Puppet and Chef had strong
          showings there. More people began to think about these newer concepts
          and wonder how they might implement them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhat in parallel, as agile development’s growth in the development
          space was reaching its most fevered pitch and moving from niche to
          common practice, this turned into thinking about “Agile Systems
          Administration” especially in Europe.&nbsp; A lot of the focus of this movement was on process and the
          analogies from kanban and lean manufacturing processes to IT systems
          administration.&nbsp; Then in 2009, Patrick Debois from Belgium and
          Andrew “Clay” Shafer from the US met and&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.jedi.be/blog/2009/12/22/charting-out-devops-ideas/">started talking up (and coined the
            term)
            DevOps</a>, and then Patrick held&nbsp;the first&nbsp;DevOpsDays event in Ghent
          that lit the fuse.&nbsp; The concept, now that it had a name, started to
          be talked up more in other venues (I found out about it at
          <a href="https://theagileadmin.com/2010/02/05/opscamp-debrief/">OpsCamp Austin</a>) including Velocity and
          DevOpsDays here in the US and spread quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/">In Patrick Debois’ view</a>,
          DevOps&nbsp;arose as a reaction against the silos and inflexibility
          that were resulting from existing practices, which probably sounds
          familiar.
          <a href="http://itrevolution.com/the-convergence-of-devops/">Here’s a good piece</a>
          by John Willis on the history of the DevOps movement that deconstructs
          the threads that came together to create it.
        </p>
        <p>
          DevOps emerged from a “perfect storm” of these things coming
          together.&nbsp; The growing automation and toolchain approach fed by
          more good monitoring and provisioning tools, the need for agile
          processes and dev/ops collaboration along with the failure of big/heavy
          implementations of ITSM/ITIL – they collided and unconsciously brought
          together all three layers of what you need for the agile movement
          (principles, process, and practices) and caught fire. Since then it has
          developed further, most notably by the inclusion of Lean principles by
          many of the thought leaders.
        </p>
        <h2>What is DevOps Not?</h2>
        <h3>It’s Not NoOps</h3>
        <p>
          It is not “they’re taking our jobs!”&nbsp; Some folks thinks that DevOps
          means that developers are taking over operations and doing it
          themselves.&nbsp; Part of that is true and part of it isn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a misconception that DevOps is coming from the development side of
          the house to wipe out operations – DevOps, and its antecedents in agile
          operations, are being initiated out of operations teams more often than
          not.&nbsp; This is because operations folks (and I speak for myself here
          as well) have realized that our existing principles, processes, and
          practices have not kept pace with what’s needed for success.&nbsp; As
          businesses and development teams need more agility as the business
          climate becomes more fast paced, we’ve often been providing less as we
          try to solve our problems with more rigidity, and we need a fundamental
          reorientation to be able to provide systems infrastructure in an
          effective manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as we realize some parts of operations need to be automated, that
          means that either we ops people do some automation development, or
          developers are writing “operations” code, or both.&nbsp; That is scary
          to some but is part of the value of the overall collaborative approach.
          All the successful teams I’ve run using this approach have both people
          with deep dev skill sets <em>and</em> deep ops skill sets working
          together to create a better overall product. And I have yet to see
          anyone automate themselves out of a job in high tech – as lower level
          concerns become more automated, technically skilled staff start solving
          the higher value problems up one level.
        </p>
        <h3>It’s Not (Just) Tools</h3>
        <p>
          DevOps is also not simply&nbsp;implementing a set of&nbsp;tools.
          &nbsp;One reason why I feel that a&nbsp;more commonly accepted
          definition of DevOps is needed is that having various&nbsp;confusing and
          poorly structured&nbsp;definitions increases the risk that people will
          pass by the “theory” and implement the processes or tools of DevOps
          without the principles in mind, which is definitely an antipattern.
          Automation is just the exercise of power, and unwise automation can do
          as much damage as wise automation can bring benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, Agile practitioners would tell you that just starting to work
          in iterations or adopting other specific practices without initiating
          meaningful collaboration is likely to not work out real well. There are
          some teams at companies I’ve worked for that adopted some of the methods
          and/or tools of agile but not its principles, and the results were
          suboptimal. Sure, a tool can be useful in Agile (or DevOps), but if you
          don’t know how to use it then it’s like giving an assault weapon to an
          untrained person.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the end, fretting about “tools shouldn’t be called DevOps” is
          misplaced. Is poker planning “agile” in the sense that doing it
          magically gets you Agile?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But it is a common tool used
          in various agile methodologies, so calling it an “agile tool” is
          appropriate. Similarly, just because DevOps is not just a sum of the
          tools doesn’t mean that tools specifically designed to run systems in
          accordance with a DevOps mindset aren’t valuable. (There are certainly a
          bunch of tools I’ve used that seem specifically designed to prevent it!)
        </p>
        <h3>It’s Not (Just) Culture</h3>
        <p>
          Many people insist that DevOps “is just culture” and you can’t apply the
          word to a given principle or practice, but I feel like this is overblown
          and incorrect. Agile has not helped thousands of dev shops because the
          work on it stopped at “culture,” with admonitions to hug coworkers and
          the lead practitioners that identified the best practices simply
          declaring it was all self-evident and refusing to be any more
          prescriptive. (Though there is some of that). DevOps consists of items
          at all the levels I list above, and is largely useless without the
          tangible body of practice that has emerged around it. You might be able
          to figure out all those best practices yourself given the cultural
          direction and lots of time to experiment, but sharing information is why
          we have the Internet (and printing press for that matter).
        </p>
        <h3>It’s Not (Just) Devs and Ops</h3>
        <p>
          And in the end, it’s not exclusionary.&nbsp; Some people have complained
          “What about security people!&nbsp; And network admins!&nbsp; Why leave
          us out!?!”&nbsp; The point is that all the participants in creating a
          product or system should collaborate from the beginning – business folks
          of various stripes, developers of various stripes, and operations folks
          of various stripes, and all this includes security, network, and whoever
          else.&nbsp; There’s a lot of different kinds of business and developer
          stakeholders as well; just because everyone doesn’t get a specific
          call-out (“Don’t forget the icon designers!”) doesn’t mean that they
          aren’t included.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original agile development guys were
          mostly thinking about “biz + dev” collaboration, and DevOps is pointing
          out issues and solutions around “dev + ops” collaboration, but the
          mature result of all this is “everyone collaborating”. In that sense,
          DevOps is just a major step for one discipline to join in on the overall
          culture of agile collaboration that should involve all disciplines in an
          organization. So whoever is participating in the delivery of the
          software or service is part of DevOps.
        </p>
        <h3>It’s Not (Just) A Job Title</h3>
        <p>
          Simply taking an existing ops team and calling them “The DevOps Team”
          doesn’t actually help anything by itself.&nbsp; Nor does changing a job
          title to “DevOps Engineer.” If you don’t adopt the values and principles
          above, which require change at an overall system level not simply within
          a given team, you won’t get all the benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I’m not in the camp that rails that you ‘can’t have DevOps in a
          job title.” It is often used in a job title as a way to distinguish “new
          style DevOps-thinking, automation-first, dev-collaborating, CI-running,
          etc. sysadmin” from “grouchy back room person who aggressively doesn’t
          care what your company does for a living.” Some people find value in
          that, others don’t, and that’s fine. As a hiring manager myself, I see a
          clear difference in the fit&nbsp;of applicants when I put it on a job
          posting for a systems engineer,&nbsp;which provides an incentive
          for&nbsp;me to keep doing so…
        </p>
        <h3>It’s Not Everything</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes, DevOps people get carried away and make grandiose claims that
          DevOps is about “everything everywhere!” Since DevOps plugs into the
          overall structure of a lot of lean and agile thinking, and there are
          opportunities for that kind of collaboration throughout an organization,
          it’s nice to see all the parallels, but going and reengineering your
          business processes isn’t really DevOps per se.&nbsp; It is part of an
          overall, hopefully collaborative and agile corporate culture, but DevOps
          is specifically about how operations plugs into that.&nbsp; Some folks
          overreach and end up turning DevOps into a super watered down version of
          Lean, Agile, or just love for everyone. Which is great at the vision
          level, but as you march down the hierarchy of granularity, you end up
          mostly dealing with operational integration – other efforts are worrying
          about the other parts (you can personally too of course). But there are
          still a lot of unsolved problems around the delivery of software and
          maintenance of services and making it fast, reliable, secure, et al. –
          if someone wants to use what they’ve learned from DevOps to go be a
          larger scope corporate consultant that’s fine, but most people involved
          in DevOps are technical practitioners who are looking for better ways to
          do <em>their</em> job, not someone else’s. &nbsp;In Agile there is
          “Agile Software Development” and then there’s the larger Agile
          organization work. I think DevOps is best defined as “Agile Software
          Delivery and Operations,” which should similarly work in concert with
          others working on larger organizational initiatives, but without losing
          sight of its primary value proposition for the organization.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Started With DevOps</h2>
        <p>
          There’s not one path to DevOps – there’s just what works in your
          organization. &nbsp;Very successful DevOps initiatives have been
          originated from dev teams and from ops teams, top down and bottom up,
          from inside the company and from consultants, with widespread education
          and with skunkwork pilots. &nbsp;Therefore it’s hard to give a generic
          playbook for how you can get it implemented. I think it’s safe to say
          that it starts with you yourself learning about the values, principles,
          methods, and practices of DevOps and trying to spread it via whatever
          channel is most effective – telling fellow techies, getting management
          buyin, just starting to implement things in a more DevOps&nbsp;way
          &nbsp;yourself and letting success speak for itself… &nbsp;People will
          try to tell you how things can rise to success in your org, but that
          advice is usually more policy and wishful thinking than reality.
          &nbsp;Observe how other popular things in your organization have arisen
          and gained currency and try those same channels. And keep learning.
